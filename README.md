## Intro to Python 3
### NICAR17 Jacksonville

The third part of a Python primer that covers how to use coding as a data journalism tool. For more, see [Part 1](https://github.com/eklucas/python-intro) ([Liz Lucas](https://github.com/eklucas), Kaiser Health News) or [Part 2](https://github.com/cathydeng/python-for-newbies) ([Cathy Deng](https://github.com/cathydeng), BuzzFeed).

We'll work on scraping a web page's data table with a Python script and packages that make the whole process easier.  

Check `requirements.txt` for a list of required external Python libraries. This session is taught in [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) to ease you into the coding waters without having to switch back and forth between a text editor and an interactive Python interpreter.
